# AI Experiment Consultant

#### From an idea, a pain point, or a screenshot to an implementation-ready UpGrade experiment plan

PELE 2026 · Work-in-Progress / Demo

**Zack Lee and April Murphy**

Carnegie Learning

<!--
Hi everyone, I'm Zack Lee, a software engineer on the Research team. This is joint work with April Murphy.

This is the talk I gave at the A/B Testing Workshop, which was part of the Festival of Learning in Seoul last month.

In this talk, I'll introduce AI Experiment Consultant, a prototype that helps educational software teams turn an idea, a pain point, or a screenshot into an implementation-ready UpGrade experiment plan.

I'll start with the practical problem that motivated this work.

<!--
(Skip UpGrade intro) Since everyone here is familiar with UpGrade, I'll skip this overview.

(Do UpGrade intro) UpGrade is Carnegie Learning's open-source platform for configuring, deploying, and managing experiments in educational software.

It's been used by Carnegie Learning and partner EdTech teams in experiments involving hundreds of thousands of students.

Experimenters use UpGrade to specify where an experiment runs, which conditions it includes, who can participate, and what outcomes to track. That location in the app is the decision point.

At runtime, the learning app sends an assignment request to UpGrade. UpGrade returns a condition, and the app applies the corresponding experience. The app then sends enrollment and outcome metrics back to UpGrade.

So the key boundary is: UpGrade orchestrates the experiment, while the learning app implements the condition-specific experience.

<!--
The hard part often comes before teams have a clear experiment plan.

In recent onboarding work with external EdTech teams, we've seen them come in with a rough idea, a pain point, or a specific interaction they want to improve, but without clear answers about what to test, where condition assignment should happen, which conditions and metrics to use, or what needs to change in the app.

Once that plan exists, UpGrade helps teams run and manage the experiment.

Today, that earlier planning step usually requires expert consultation. This project addresses that planning gap.

<!--
AI Experiment Consultant is a web-based, chat-driven tool for educational software teams.

The starting point can be an idea, a pain point, or a screenshot.

Through a guided consultation, the tool asks follow-up questions, suggests possible directions, and helps turn that input into a concrete A/B test plan.

The main output is an implementation-ready markdown report tailored to UpGrade, so the plan can be shared and acted on after the conversation.

Throughout the process, the tool remains human-controlled and planning-focused: it suggests options and structures the plan, but the user decides what to approve or change.

<!--
The consultant follows a six-phase workflow, but to the user it still feels like a guided chat.

First, it asks about the learning app: what it does, who uses it, and what students are trying to learn.

Second, it asks about the specific page, problem, or interaction where an experiment might happen. A screenshot can help, but the user can also describe it in text.

Third, it helps turn the starting point into a testable hypothesis. This is where it can suggest possible interventions and outcome metrics, and also offer optional related research grounding.

Fourth, it translates the approved hypothesis into an UpGrade experiment design, including the decision point, conditions, and metrics.

Fifth, it can run an optional synthetic preflight using simulated participants. This is mainly meant to show what enrollment and metric data look like in UpGrade, not to provide evidence of learning effects.

Sixth, it generates the final markdown report.

The user approves every major transition before the tool moves on.

  </div>
</div>

<!--
Before the demo, I want to highlight the report as the main output, not just the last step in the chat.

The conversation ends as a structured markdown report. It pulls together the hypothesis, the UpGrade experiment design, the simulation summary, and step-by-step implementation guidance.

This makes the report a shared artifact. Researchers, developers, and product teams can use it to align on the experiment design and implementation plan.

And because it's plain markdown, it can also serve as a concrete spec for later implementation work. This can include work supported by AI coding tools, with a person still reviewing any resulting changes.

Now let's see this in a short demo. I'll use a fictional app called MiniMathApp — a simple math-practice app for middle-school students.

This page shows an area word problem about a rectangular garden, along with a diagram, an answer box, and a "Check answer" button. The team noticed that many students get stuck or answer incorrectly on the first try.

Notice that we haven't chosen an intervention yet. We'll start from this problem page and the pain point, and ask the consultant to help us plan an experiment.

Let's switch to the live demo.

<!--
So this is the login page. It also gives a quick overview of what the tool does. I'll sign in. (Click "Sign in as Zack")

Now we're in the chat. The consultant starts by asking about the learning app.

(Read) "To start, tell...is it for?"

There are also starter options if you're not sure where to begin.

I'll give it just the app-level context first.

(Paste/Read/Send)
<div class="cl-note-copy-box">
  <span class="cl-note-copy-text">
MiniMathApp is a math practice app for middle-school students. Students work through one problem at a time in topic-based practice units.

</div>

(After response) And it says:

(Read) "Thanks. Which page...if you have one."

So I'll upload the screenshot (Upload minimath-screenshot.png)

Then I'll paste the page description and the pain point.

(Paste/Read/Send)
<div class="cl-note-copy-box">
  <span class="cl-note-copy-text">
This is an area word-problem page about a rectangular garden. Many students get stuck or answer incorrectly on the first try.<br><br>We have not chosen an intervention yet. Please suggest a few A/B test ideas and recommend a good starting experiment.
  </span>
  <button type="button" class="cl-note-copy-button" title="Copy prompt" aria-label="Copy prompt" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.previousElementSibling.innerText.trim()).then(() => { this.classList.add('is-copied'); this.title = 'Copied'; window.setTimeout(() => { this.classList.remove('is-copied'); this.title = 'Copy prompt'; }, 1000); })"><span class="cl-note-copy-icon cl-note-copy-icon-default" aria-hidden="true">⧉</span><span class="cl-note-copy-icon cl-note-copy-icon-copied" aria-hidden="true">✓</span></button>
</div>

(After response) Okay, it gives me three experiment ideas:

(Read) "Optional hint button...Scaffolded steps."

Then it recommends starting with the optional hint button:

(Read) "It is a small...who are stuck."

It also proposes a hypothesis:

(Read) "Adding an optional...the current page."

This sounds reasonable, so I'll approve it and move forward by replying:

(Paste/Read/Send)
<div class="cl-note-copy-box">
  <span class="cl-note-copy-text">
Let's use the optional hint-button idea and the proposed hypothesis.
  </span>
  <button type="button" class="cl-note-copy-button" title="Copy prompt" aria-label="Copy prompt" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.previousElementSibling.innerText.trim()).then(() => { this.classList.add('is-copied'); this.title = 'Copied'; window.setTimeout(() => { this.classList.remove('is-copied'); this.title = 'Copy prompt'; }, 1000); })"><span class="cl-note-copy-icon cl-note-copy-icon-default" aria-hidden="true">⧉</span><span class="cl-note-copy-icon cl-note-copy-icon-copied" aria-hidden="true">✓</span></button>
</div>

(After response) And it says:

(Read) "Great. The hint-button...refine this hypothesis?"

I'll say yes here. (Type "yes" and send)

(While `search_papers` is running)

Now it's searching Semantic Scholar with a few related queries, narrowing the candidate papers, and then summarizing up to three of the most relevant papers for this experiment.

(After response) Okay, it says:

(Read) "These papers don't...the experiment design."

(Scroll down) And it found three related papers, each with a relevance note and a design implication.

(Scroll down) Then it says:

(Read) "Taken together, these...UpGrade experiment design?"

As the AI notes, overall hint usage would show how often students open the hint, but not whether they use it well.

So I'll make the metric more specific: I want to track whether students open the hint before submitting a first answer.

(Paste/Read/Send)
<div class="cl-note-copy-box">
  <span class="cl-note-copy-text">
Please apply the research grounding, but track premature hint use instead of overall hint use. Measure whether a student opens the hint before submitting a first answer, so we can distinguish students who try first from those who go straight to the hint. Then continue to the experiment design.
  </span>
  <button type="button" class="cl-note-copy-button" title="Copy prompt" aria-label="Copy prompt" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.previousElementSibling.innerText.trim()).then(() => { this.classList.add('is-copied'); this.title = 'Copied'; window.setTimeout(() => { this.classList.remove('is-copied'); this.title = 'Copy prompt'; }, 1000); })"><span class="cl-note-copy-icon cl-note-copy-icon-default" aria-hidden="true">⧉</span><span class="cl-note-copy-icon cl-note-copy-icon-copied" aria-hidden="true">✓</span></button>
</div>

(After response) Okay, it says:

(Read) "That makes sense...of premature help-seeking."

Then it turns that into a proposed UpGrade experiment design.

(Scroll down) The design has one decision point, two conditions with a 50/50 split, and three metrics:

(Read) "firstAttemptCorrect...prematureHintUse."

For the new metric, it says:

(Read) "At the first...and time-on-task."

I could still change any of these details, but this is the design I want, so I'll approve it. (Type "yes" and send)

(After response) It says:

(Read) "Design approved...of real outcomes."

I'll say yes to run the preflight. (Type "yes" and send)

(While `run_simulation` is running)

Now it's creating a temporary UpGrade experiment and simulating 200 synthetic participants, and then it will clean up the temporary data.

This is just a preflight of the data flow, not a test with real students.

(After response) Okay, it shows the enrollment and metric tables. I'll read the summary:

(Read) "The assignment split...no hint button."

And it reminds us:

(Read) "These numbers are...real learning outcomes."

Then it offers to generate the final report with all of these sections.

(Scroll down) And it says:

(Read) "Reply yes to...which ones instead."

I'll keep everything in for this demo. (Type "yes" and send)

(While `generate_report` is running)

Now it's generating a Markdown report that combines the experiment plan with implementation guidance. This usually takes about 20 seconds.

(After report panel opens) Now the report is ready in the side panel.

(Scroll slowly) It starts with the high-level plan: the Summary, the Learning App Description, the Page / Problem Description, the Experiment Idea, and the Hypothesis.

(Scroll slowly) It also includes the Related Research Grounding, the Proposed UpGrade Experiment Design, and the Simulation Result Summary.

(Pause at Recommended Implementation Order) Here, the report turns the plan into a practical sequence: set up UpGrade, configure the experiment, integrate the client, and verify that the data appears.

A team could follow these steps directly, or use the report as a starting spec for an AI coding tool, with a developer still reviewing the work.

(Scroll slowly until the client code) Below that are the UpGrade Setup Guide, the UpGrade Experiment Creation Guide, and the Client Integration Guide, including code examples.

So the final output is not just a chat transcript. It becomes a handoff artifact that a researcher, developer, or product team can share and build from.

And because it's Markdown, it can be copied or downloaded from here. (Point to the copy/download buttons)

<!--
Now I'll wrap up with the current scope and future direction.

Today, this is a planning-focused MVP, designed for simple UpGrade experiments such as one decision point with basic conditions and metrics. That's a deliberate choice for this prototype, not a limit of UpGrade.

One guardrail from the demo is that the synthetic preflight is mainly meant to show what enrollment and metric data look like in UpGrade, not to provide evidence of learning effects.

The next step is evaluation with real teams, which we haven't done yet. We plan to do that during Fall 2026 UpGrade onboarding.

Looking ahead, an approved report could become the shared input for a human-reviewed pipeline. AI and automation could help draft client-app changes, prepare the UpGrade configuration, and later support experiment analysis, with humans reviewing each step.

(After response) Okay, it gives me three experiment ideas:

(Read) "Optional hint button...Scaffolded steps."

Then it recommends starting with the optional hint button:

(Read) "It is a small...who are stuck."

It also proposes a hypothesis:

(Read) "Adding an optional...the current page."

This sounds reasonable, so I'll approve it and move forward by replying:

<div class="cl-note-copy-box">
  <span class="cl-note-copy-text">
Let's use the optional hint-button idea and the proposed hypothesis.

  <button type="button" class="cl-note-copy-button" title="Copy prompt" aria-label="Copy prompt" onclick="navigator.clipboard.writeText(this.previousElementSibling.innerText.trim()).then(() => { this.classList.add('is-copied'); this.title = 'Copied'; window.setTimeout(() => { this.classList.remove('is-copied'); this.title = 'Copy prompt'; }, 1000); })"><span class="cl-note-copy-icon cl-note-copy-icon-default" aria-hidden="true">⧉</span><span class="cl-note-copy-icon cl-note-copy-icon-copied" aria-hidden="true">✓</span></button>
</div>

(After response) And it says:

(Read) "Great. The hint-button...refine this hypothesis?"

I'll say yes here. (Type "yes" and send)

(While `search_papers` is running)

Now it's searching Semantic Scholar with a few related queries, narrowing the candidate papers, and then summarizing up to three of the most relevant papers for this experiment.

(After response) Okay, it says:

(Read) "These papers don't...the experiment design."

(Scroll down) And it found three related papers, each with a relevance note and a design implication.

(Scroll down) Then it says:

(Read) "Taken together, these...UpGrade experiment design?"

As the AI notes, overall hint usage would show how often students open the hint, but not whether they use it well.

So I'll make the metric more specific: I want to track whether students open the hint before submitting a first answer.

  <span class="cl-note-copy-text">
Please apply the research grounding, but track premature hint use instead of overall hint use. Measure whether a student opens the hint before submitting a first answer, so we can distinguish students who try first from those who go straight to the hint. Then continue to the experiment design.

(After response) Okay, it says:

(Read) "That makes sense...of premature help-seeking."

Then it turns that into a proposed UpGrade experiment design.

(Scroll down) The design has one decision point, two conditions with a 50/50 split, and three metrics:

(Read) "firstAttemptCorrect...prematureHintUse."

For the new metric, it says:

(Read) "At the first...and time-on-task."

I could still change any of these details, but this is the design I want, so I'll approve it. (Type "yes" and send)

(After response) It says:

(Read) "Design approved...of real outcomes."

I'll say yes to run the preflight. (Type "yes" and send)

(While `run_simulation` is running)

Now it's creating a temporary UpGrade experiment and simulating 200 synthetic participants, and then it will clean up the temporary data.

This is just a preflight of the data flow, not a test with real students.

(After response) Okay, it shows the enrollment and metric tables. I'll read the summary:

(Read) "The assignment split...no hint button."

And it reminds us:

(Read) "These numbers are...real learning outcomes."

Then it offers to generate the final report with all of these sections.

(Scroll down) And it says:

(Read) "Reply yes to...which ones instead."

I'll keep everything in for this demo. (Type "yes" and send)

(While `generate_report` is running)

Now it's generating a Markdown report that combines the experiment plan with implementation guidance. This usually takes about 20 seconds.

(After report panel opens) Now the report is ready in the side panel.

(Scroll slowly) It starts with the high-level plan: the Summary, the Learning App Description, the Page / Problem Description, the Experiment Idea, and the Hypothesis.

(Scroll slowly) It also includes the Related Research Grounding, the Proposed UpGrade Experiment Design, and the Simulation Result Summary.

(Pause at Recommended Implementation Order) Here, the report turns the plan into a practical sequence: set up UpGrade, configure the experiment, integrate the client, and verify that the data appears.

A team could follow these steps directly, or use the report as a starting spec for an AI coding tool, with a developer still reviewing the work.

(Scroll slowly until the client code) Below that are the UpGrade Setup Guide, the UpGrade Experiment Creation Guide, and the Client Integration Guide, including code examples.

So the final output is not just a chat transcript. It becomes a handoff artifact that a researcher, developer, or product team can share and build from.

And because it's Markdown, it can be copied or downloaded from here. (Point to the copy/download buttons)
